## Backend API Services

### `Backend/api/services/performance_calculator.py`

*   **TODO**: Several metrics in `calculate_performance_metrics` are set to `None` (`profit_factor`, `average_win`, `average_loss`, `annualized_return`, `volatility`). These could be implemented for more comprehensive performance analysis.

## Backend API Strategies

### `Backend/api/strategies/ma_crossover_strategy.py`

*   **TODO**: The use of `sys.path.append` is not a robust way to handle imports. The project should be structured as a proper Python package to avoid manual path manipulation.

### `Backend/api/strategies/rsi_strategy.py`

*   **TODO**: Similar to the MA crossover strategy, this file uses `sys.path.append`. This should be refactored by setting up the project as an installable package.

## Backend API Tests

### `Backend/api/tests/test_validation.py`

*   **Note**: The tests rely on fixtures (`mock_db`, `sample_simulation_config`) that are likely defined in a `conftest.py` file.

## C++ Engine Analysis

### C++ Engine Headers (`Backend/cpp-engine/include/`)

*   **`argument_parser.h`**: The `SimulationConfig` struct has hardcoded members for different strategies (e.g., `short_ma`, `rsi_period`), which is not scalable. Consider using a `std::map<std::string, double>` for strategy parameters.
*   **`command_dispatcher.h`**: The return types for the private `execute*` methods are inconsistent (`int` vs. `bool`). They should be standardized.
*   **`database_service.h`**: This class appears to be a thin wrapper around `MarketData`. Evaluate if this abstraction is necessary.
*   **`error_utils.h`**: The `fromException` and `fromExceptionVoid` functions contain duplicated code and could be refactored.
*   **`execution_service.h`**: The `getFailedExecutions` method is incomplete and always returns 0.
*   **`portfolio.h`**: The `updateValue` method is an empty placeholder.
*   **`technical_indicators.h`**: The `calculateBollingerBands` function returns a flat vector, which is not intuitive. It should return a struct or a vector of structs.
*   **`trading_engine.h`**: The `BacktestConfig` and `SimulationConfig` structs are very similar and should be merged. The `runBacktestMultiSymbol` and `optimizeMemoryUsage` methods are incomplete.

### C++ Engine Source Files (`Backend/cpp-engine/src/`)

*   **`argument_parser.cpp`**: The file uses `std::cerr` for debugging, which should be replaced with the `Logger` class for consistency.
*   **`command_dispatcher.cpp`**: The logic for handling different command-line arguments is complex and could be simplified. The `runBacktest` and `executeSimulation` functions have overlapping logic with `runSimulationFromConfig`.
*   **`market_data.cpp`**: The `getCurrentDate`, `isValidDateFormat`, and `formatDate` static methods could be moved to a separate utility file.
*   **`trading_engine.cpp`**: The `runSimulationWithParams` method duplicates logic from `runBacktest`. The `prepareMarketData` function has duplicated error logging messages. The logic for calculating winning/losing trades in `finalizeBacktestResults` could be simplified.
*   **`trading_strategy.cpp`**: The `applyRiskManagement` function uses a "rough estimate" for portfolio value, which should be improved.

### C++ Engine Tests (`Backend/cpp-engine/tests/`)

*   **`engine_testing.sh`**: This is an integration test script that interacts with the running API. The `test_database_failure_scenarios` function does not actually simulate a database failure; it only checks the current state. This test should be improved to create a real failure condition.
*   **`test_basic.cpp`**: This file uses custom-defined macros for assertions (`ASSERT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.) instead of a standard C++ testing framework like GTest or Catch2. While functional, using a standard framework would provide more features and better reporting. The `<cassert>` header is included but not used.

### C++ Engine Root Files (`Backend/cpp-engine/`)

*   **`CMakeLists.txt`**: The library linking logic for `nlohmann_json` and `libpq` is duplicated for every executable and could be simplified by using a function or macro.
*   **`Dockerfile`**: Only the `test_basic` executable is run. It would be more robust to run all compiled tests to ensure the build is valid. The `HEALTHCHECK` command could be improved by executing a simple command like `--status` instead of just checking for the file's existence.
*   **`build.sh`**: The script redirects all output from `cmake` and `make` to `/dev/null`, which suppresses important warnings and errors. This output should be logged to a file for easier debugging.

## Database Scripts

### `Database/CSVtoPostgres.py`

*   **TODO**: The database configuration (`DB_CONFIG`) is hardcoded. This should be loaded from environment variables to align with best practices and the configuration of the main API.

### Docker (`Docker/`)

- **`docker-compose.yml` & `docker-compose.dev.yml`**:
  - **Issue**: Inconsistent environment variable strategy for the `cpp-engine` service. The `dev` file uses individual variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, etc.), while the production `yml` uses a single `DATABASE_URL`. The C++ application is likely configured for only one of these, which could cause connection failures in the other environment.
  - **Recommendation**: Unify the environment variable strategy across all environments. The C++ application should be updated to parse a single `DATABASE_URL` if possible, as this is a more standard convention.

  - **Issue**: The `command` for the `cpp-engine` service is overly complex. It manually copies the compiled binary to a shared volume and uses `tail -f /dev/null` to keep the container alive. The production file also contains `ls` commands used for debugging.
  - **Recommendation**: Refactor the `cpp-engine` Dockerfile to use a multi-stage build. The first stage can compile the C++ code, and the final, clean stage can copy the binary from the build stage. This eliminates the need for complex shell commands and volume sharing for the binary itself. Remove the `ls` commands from the production configuration.

  - **Issue**: The health check for the `cpp-engine` service (`test: ["CMD", "test", "-x", "/shared/trading_engine"]`) is insufficient. It only checks for the file's existence and executable permission, not whether the application is running or healthy.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement a proper health check endpoint in the C++ engine. This could be a simple TCP port that responds to connections or a status file that the engine updates periodically.

- **`health-check.sh` & `monitoring.py`**:
  - **Issue**: The project contains two separate and redundant health monitoring scripts with significant functional overlap. `health-check.sh` is a shell script for general checks, while `monitoring.py` is a more advanced Python script with alerting capabilities.
  - **Recommendation**: Consolidate the monitoring efforts into a single tool. Decide whether the shell script's simplicity or the Python script's features are more appropriate. The chosen tool should be documented as the standard for health checks. Remove the obsolete script to reduce redundancy.

  - **Issue**: Both monitoring scripts contain hardcoded configuration values, such as service URLs, thresholds, and log file paths.
  - **Recommendation**: Externalize all configuration from the scripts. Use environment variables or a separate configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) to make the scripts more flexible and easier to manage across different environments.

  - **Issue**: `monitoring.py` uses `subprocess` to execute `docker ps`. If this script is intended to run inside a container, it would require mounting the host's Docker socket, which is a significant security risk.
  - **Recommendation**: If container monitoring is required, use a dedicated sidecar container or an agent designed for that purpose rather than relying on direct Docker socket access from an application monitoring script. Clarify the intended execution environment for this script in the documentation.

### Frontend Component Tests (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/components/__tests__/`)

- **`Dashboard.test.tsx`**:
  - **Redundant Test**: The test `'renders dashboard title'` is redundant. The test `'passes correct props to StockChart component'` also checks for the existence of the dashboard title, making the first test unnecessary.
  - **Misleading Test**: The test `'renders StockChart component'` does not actually verify that the `StockChart` component is rendered. It asserts that the "Stock Symbol" text is present, which is always true regardless of whether the chart is visible.
  - **Weak Assertions**: The tests for loading and error states (`'handles loading state from useStockData'` and `'handles error state from useStockData'`) are weak. They assert that the "Stock Symbol" text is present, which does not confirm that a loading spinner or an error message is displayed. The assertions should be more specific.
  - **Recommendation**: Remove the redundant and misleading tests. Strengthen the assertions in the loading and error state tests to check for specific UI elements related to those states.

### Frontend Common Components (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/components/common/`)

- **General**:
  - **Inconsistent Styling**: There is a significant mix of styling approaches. While components like `Button.tsx` and `Card.tsx` correctly use utility classes (likely from Tailwind CSS), others such as `DateRangeSelector.tsx`, `FormInput.tsx`, and `LoadingWrapper.tsx` rely heavily on inline styles. This leads to an inconsistent UI, violates the established styling convention, and makes maintenance difficult.
  - **Recommendation**: Refactor all components to use utility classes exclusively. Remove all inline `style` objects and replace them with the appropriate classes from the project's design system.

- **`DateRangeSelector.tsx`**:
  - **Component Underutilization**: This component implements its own styled `<input>` and `<button>` elements instead of using the existing `FormInput.tsx` and `Button.tsx` components. This leads to code duplication and visual inconsistencies.
  - **Missing Hook Dependencies**: The `useEffect` hook is missing `onStartDateChange`, `onEndDateChange`, and `autoSetDatesOnSymbolChange` in its dependency array. This can lead to stale closures and bugs where the component does not react to prop changes.
  - **Code Duplication**: The `renderDateInput` function contains nearly identical blocks of code for its `card` and `compact` variants. This logic should be consolidated.
  - **Recommendation**: Rework the component to use the common `FormInput` and `Button` components. Add the missing dependencies to the `useEffect` array. Refactor the `renderDateInput` function to remove the duplicated code.

- **`FormInput.tsx`**:
  - **Component Underutilization**: This component is not used in other parts of the application where it would be appropriate (e.g., `DateRangeSelector.tsx`).
  - **Recommendation**: Identify all instances of raw `<input>` elements in the application and replace them with this common component to ensure consistency.

### Frontend Root Components (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/components/`)

- **General**:
  - **Inconsistent Styling**: Components like `Dashboard.tsx`, `SimulationProgress.tsx`, `SimulationResults.tsx`, `SimulationSetup.tsx`, and `StockChart.tsx` heavily rely on inline styles for layout, typography, and other visual properties. This is inconsistent with the project's apparent use of utility-first CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS) and makes the components harder to maintain, theme, and reuse.
  - **Recommendation**: Replace all inline styles with appropriate utility classes. This will improve consistency, readability, and maintainability.

- **`Dashboard.tsx`**:
  - **Hardcoded Dates**: The initial `startDate` and `endDate` states are empty strings, but the `DateRangeSelector` component (which is used within Dashboard) has hardcoded default dates. This can lead to a mismatch or require manual synchronization.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure that the initial state of `startDate` and `endDate` in `Dashboard.tsx` aligns with the default or fetched values from `DateRangeSelector` to avoid inconsistencies.

  - **Limited Timeframe Options**: The `timeframe` state is hardcoded to `'daily'`, and the dropdown only offers "Daily" as an option. This limits the dashboard's functionality.
  - **Recommendation**: If other timeframes are intended to be supported, implement the necessary logic and API calls to fetch data for those timeframes and update the UI accordingly.

- **`SimulationProgress.tsx`**:
  - **Inline Styles for Animation**: The loading spinner and progress bar animations are implemented using inline `style` attributes with `animation` properties. This makes it difficult to manage and extend animations.
  - **Recommendation**: Define animations in a CSS file and apply them via class names for better maintainability and reusability.

  - **Hardcoded Steps**: The simulation steps are hardcoded within the component. This makes the component less flexible if the simulation process changes.
  - **Recommendation**: Pass the simulation steps as a prop or fetch them from a configuration source to make the component more dynamic and reusable.

- **`SimulationResults.tsx`**:
  - **Chart.js `destroy()` Call**: The `useEffect` hook attempts to call `(chart as any).destroy()` on unmount. While this is a common pattern for Chart.js, `react-chartjs-2` typically handles chart destruction automatically. This might be redundant or cause issues if `chartRef.current` is not a Chart.js instance.
  - **Recommendation**: Verify if the explicit `destroy()` call is necessary. If `react-chartjs-2` handles it, remove this `useEffect` hook.

  - **Redundant Chart.js Registration**: The `ChartJS.register` call is duplicated in `StockChart.tsx`. This is unnecessary and can lead to larger bundle sizes.
  - **Recommendation**: Centralize Chart.js registration in a single file (e.g., `index.tsx` or a dedicated chart utility file) to avoid duplication.

- **`SimulationSetup.tsx`**:
  - **Inline Styles**: Extensive use of inline styles for layout and form elements.
  - **Recommendation**: Replace inline styles with utility classes.

  - **Manual Stock Selection**: The stock selection uses a multi-select dropdown with manual "Add all" and "Clear all" buttons. While functional, this could be improved with a more modern and user-friendly component (e.g., a search-enabled multi-select with tags).
  - **Recommendation**: Consider replacing the native multi-select with a more feature-rich component for better UX.

  - **Strategy Parameter Handling**: The logic for rendering and updating strategy-specific parameters is directly embedded within the `SimulationSetup` component. This makes the component large and complex.
  - **Recommendation**: Abstract the strategy parameter forms into separate sub-components or use a custom hook to manage strategy-specific state and rendering logic.

- **`StockChart.tsx`**:
  - **Redundant Chart.js Registration**: Similar to `SimulationResults.tsx`, `ChartJS.register` is duplicated here.
  - **Recommendation**: Centralize Chart.js registration.

  - **Unused `chartRef`**: The `chartRef` is declared and assigned, but its `useEffect` cleanup function is likely unnecessary for the same reasons as in `SimulationResults.tsx`.
  - **Recommendation**: Verify and remove if redundant.

  - **Incomplete Chart Types**: The `candlestick` and `ohlc` chart types are defined but currently render a line chart with color variations. This indicates that the full implementation for these chart types (e.g., using `react-chartjs-2`'s financial charts or a custom plugin) is missing.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement proper rendering for `candlestick` and `ohlc` charts or remove these options if they are not intended to be fully supported.

  - **Volume Chart Logic**: The `volumeChartData` and `volumeOptions` are always prepared, even when `showVolume` is `false`. This is a minor inefficiency.
  - **Recommendation**: Conditionally prepare `volumeChartData` and `volumeOptions` only when `showVolume` is `true`.

### Frontend Hooks (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/hooks/`)

- **`useSimulation.ts`**:
  - **Unnecessary `cleanup()` call**: The `simulationService.cleanup()` call in the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is likely unnecessary and potentially problematic if `simulationService` is a singleton. Calling `cleanup()` on every component unmount could lead to unexpected behavior for other components still using the service.
  - **Recommendation**: Review the lifecycle of `simulationService`. If it's a singleton meant to persist across the application, the `cleanup()` call in the `useEffect` should be removed. If it's meant to be disposed of with the component, ensure its design supports this pattern without affecting other parts of the application.

  - **Direct State Access**: The hook directly exposes the internal `state` object from `simulationService`. While not strictly an issue, it tightly couples the hook's return value to the internal structure of `SimulationState`.
  - **Recommendation**: Consider destructuring and exposing only the necessary properties from `state` in the return object to provide a more stable and encapsulated API for the hook.

  - **Hardcoded `timeframe`**: The `timeframe` parameter in `useStockData` is hardcoded to `'daily'`. This limits the flexibility of the hook and the components that consume it.
  - **Recommendation**: If other timeframes are to be supported, modify the hook to accept a more flexible `timeframe` parameter and ensure the `apiService.getStockData` call can handle different timeframes.

  - **Generic Error Handling**: The error handling in `useStockData` is generic (`'Failed to fetch data'`). While functional, providing more specific error messages based on the API response could improve the user experience and aid in debugging.
  - **Recommendation**: Enhance the error handling to parse and return more specific error messages from the `apiService` response, if available.

### Frontend Services (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/services/`)

- **`api.ts`**:
  - **Generic Error Handling**: The `fetchWithErrorHandling` method uses a custom error structure that includes `errorDetails` and `errors`. While this is flexible, the `Error` object's `message` property is often a generic "HTTP error!" or "Failed to fetch data".
  - **Recommendation**: Enhance the error handling to propagate more specific error messages from the backend API responses to improve debugging and user feedback.

  - **Loose Pagination Type**: The `pagination` property returned by `getStocks` and `getStockData` is typed as `any`, which reduces type safety.
  - **Recommendation**: Define a proper interface for the `pagination` object to improve type safety and clarity.

  - **Inconsistent `cancelSimulation` Parameter**: The `cancelSimulation` method in `api.ts` expects a `simulationId` parameter, but the `simulationService` (which calls this method) relies on an internally managed `currentSimulationId`. This is a valid design choice, but it creates a tight coupling between the service and the API layer.
  - **Recommendation**: Document this dependency clearly or consider if `cancelSimulation` in `api.ts` should be refactored to not require the `simulationId` if it's always managed internally by `simulationService`.

- **`__tests__/api.test.ts`**:

- **`simulation/simulationService.ts`**:
  - **Service Lifecycle Management**: The `cleanup()` method calls `pollingService.cleanup()` and `simulationStateManager.unsubscribe()`. This suggests that `SimulationService` is intended to manage the lifecycle of these sub-services. This is a valid pattern but implies that `SimulationService` itself should have a clear lifecycle (e.g., initialized once at application startup and cleaned up on application shutdown).
  - **Recommendation**: Document the intended lifecycle of `SimulationService` and its sub-services. Ensure that `SimulationService` is properly initialized and cleaned up at the appropriate points in the application's lifecycle.

  - **Generic Error Messages**: Similar to `api.ts`, the error messages propagated from `simulationAPI` calls are often generic (e.g., `'Failed to start simulation'`).
  - **Recommendation**: Enhance the error handling to propagate more specific error details from the `simulationAPI` responses to improve user feedback and debugging.

### Frontend Styles (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/styles/`)

- **`utilities.css`**:

  - **Underutilized Utility Classes**: While `utilities.css` defines general-purpose classes like `form-input` and various `btn-*` classes, many components still use extensive inline styles for form inputs and buttons.
  - **Recommendation**: Consistently apply the defined utility classes across the codebase to leverage the benefits of a utility-first CSS framework and improve styling consistency.

  - **Potential Redundancy in Spinner Utilities**: The `spinner-lg-blue`, `spinner-md-blue`, and `spinner-sm-white` classes are defined, but the `Spinner.tsx` component already handles size and color variations through its props.
  - **Recommendation**: If `Spinner.tsx` is the only component responsible for rendering spinners, these custom spinner utility classes might be redundant and can be removed.

### Frontend Root Files (`Frontend/trading-platform-ui/src/`)

- **`App.tsx`**:
  - **Inline Styles**: The component uses inline styles for layout and typography.
  - **Recommendation**: Replace inline styles with appropriate utility classes for consistency and maintainability.

  - **Conditional Rendering Logic**: The conditional rendering of `SimulationProgress`, `SimulationResults`, and `SimulationSetup` based on `simulationState` is quite verbose.
  - **Recommendation**: Consider simplifying the conditional rendering logic, possibly using a state machine pattern or a more compact rendering approach, especially if the number of states grows.

- **`index.css`**:
  - **Global Styles**: This file contains global CSS rules, including a custom `spin` animation.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure that the `spin` animation is consistently applied from this global stylesheet and remove any inline or duplicated animation definitions in components.


- **`jest.polyfills.js`**:
  - **Polyfill Purpose**: This file likely contains polyfills for Jest's testing environment.
  - **Recommendation**: Document the specific polyfills included and their necessity. Regularly review if these polyfills are still required with newer Node.js or Jest versions.

### Project Root Files (`/home/krystian/Desktop/Simulated_Trading_Platform/`)

- **`.env.example`**:
  - **Completeness**: While providing a good example, it might be beneficial to include all possible environment variables that the application could use (even with default values) to offer a comprehensive overview for new developers.
  - **Recommendation**: Review and update `.env.example` to include all environment variables used across the project, along with brief descriptions.

- **`setup.sh`**:
  - **Idempotency**: Some steps check for existing installations, but the script could be made more robustly idempotent to ensure it can be run multiple times without issues or requiring manual cleanup.
  - **Recommendation**: Review and improve idempotency for all setup steps.

- **`test_all.sh`**:
  - **Test Metrics Collection**: The parsing of test results using `grep -o` and `head -1` can be fragile.
  - **Recommendation**: Consider using more robust methods for parsing test output, such as JSON reporters from test runners, if available, to ensure accurate metric collection.

  - **Conditional Test Execution**: The logic for checking and building C++ tests is good, but similar explicit dependency checks could be beneficial for Python and Frontend tests before attempting to run them.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement more explicit dependency checks for all test suites to ensure necessary environments are set up before execution.

  - **API Dependency for Engine Tests**: The script checks for API availability before running "API Engine Tests."
  - **Recommendation**: Document this dependency clearly. If these tests are critical, consider adding a mechanism to automatically start the API for testing purposes within the CI/CD pipeline or provide clear instructions for developers.

- **`test_integration.sh`**:
  - **Test 4 (JSON Validation)**: The test uses an indirect method to check module availability.
  - **Recommendation**: Refactor this test to directly assert the expected behavior of the JSON validation logic rather than just module availability.

  - **Test 8 (Database Connection Recovery)**: This test's effectiveness is limited if the API is not running.
  - **Recommendation**: Improve this test to actively simulate a database connection failure and verify the application's recovery or error handling, rather than just checking API health.

  - **Test 9 (Error Scenario Testing)**: The error scenario testing is basic.
  - **Recommendation**: Expand error scenario testing to include a wider range of malformed inputs and edge cases, asserting specific error responses and behaviors.

  - **Test 10 (Test Data Consistency)**: This test is a placeholder.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement the actual test data consistency checks as planned for Phase 3.
