### Notes:

**Stocks.py**

Data retrieval - When retrieving stock data is only daily data considered? Missing intraday?

**Database.py**

Missing error output - '_get_cache' returns if key not valid with no further output

Adjust error tolerance / gaps - 'validate_date_range_has_data' requires only 50% of data, with new data acquisition this should increment

Implementation - is 'validate_multiple_symbols' implemented yet? Running simulation through the frontend port 3000 only accounts for one symbol.

**models.py**

RSI - Is RSI implemented yet (included in strategy-specific parameters)?

**performance_optimizer.py**

TODO: optimize_multi_symbol_simulation and execute_parallel_simulation_groups (Line 64 and 85)

**simulation_engine.py**

Possible bloat - PerformanceOptimizer is not accessed/used?

Line 146 - Implement multi-symbol simulation

Line 194 - Not that useful at the moment (Singular symbol support and singular strategy support)

**validation.py**

Line 177 - As strategies get developed with multi-symbolic execution consider lowering this amount

**Database/data_utils.py**

In future, ensure consistent DB formatting between daily and intraday to remove get_date_column and reduce the necessity of this file

**Backend/cpp-engine/trading_strategy**

## Development Plan to Address Identified Issues

### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation
**Priority: High**

4. **Implement Multi-Symbol Simulation Support**
   - Modify C++ engine to handle multiple symbols simultaneously
   - Update `simulation_engine.py:146-148` to process all symbols, not just first
   - Extend database queries to support multi-symbol data retrieval
   - Update validation logic for multi-symbol configurations

5. **Complete RSI Strategy Implementation**
   - Verify RSI is fully connected to simulation execution pipeline
   - Test RSI parameter validation and execution
   - Ensure RSI signals are properly generated and acted upon

6. **Activate Performance Optimizer Usage**
   - Implement actual parallel processing for multi-symbol simulations
   - Complete `optimize_multi_symbol_simulation()` and `execute_parallel_simulation_groups()`
   - Add performance monitoring and caching optimizations

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
**Priority: Low**

10. **Intraday Data Support**
    - Extend stock data retrieval to include intraday timeframes
    - Update frontend to allow intraday simulation selection
    - Modify validation to support intraday date ranges

11. **Advanced Position Management**
    - Allow position increases in existing holdings
    - Implement more sophisticated portfolio rebalancing

### Codebase Improvements

#### **High Priority Security & Performance Fixes**

3. **Memory Leak in Simulation Loop** - `Backend/cpp-engine/src/trading_engine.cpp:160-188`
   - Pre-allocate data structures instead of creating new historical windows repeatedly
   - Use sliding window approach for historical data processing
   - Significant memory usage optimization

#### **Architecture & Code Quality**


7. **Configuration Management** - `Docker/docker-compose.yml:33,48`
   - Fix database URL inconsistencies between services
   - Centralize configuration with environment variable validation

#### **Error Handling & Monitoring**

11. **Health Checks Missing** - Docker configuration
    - Add health check endpoints for all services
    - Implement graceful service startup ordering
    - Add monitoring and alerting capabilities

#### **API & Testing Improvements**

15. **Response Format Consistency** - Various router files
    - Standardize API response format across all endpoints
    - Implement proper error response structure

18. **Comprehensive Testing** - Test coverage gaps
    - Add unit tests for all components
    - Implement integration test suite
