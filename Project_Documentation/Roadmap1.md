  - [x] Implement sell signal (short MA crosses below long MA)
  - [x] Add position sizing logic (fixed percentage)

### Integration with Engine

- [x] Connect strategy to simulation engine
- [x] Implement strategy initialization
- [x] Add daily strategy evaluation loop

  - [x] Date range selector
  - [x] Stock selection (multi-select)
  - [x] Strategy parameters (MA periods)
- [x] Build simulation progress indicator
- [x] Implement results display page:
  - [x] Final portfolio value
  - [x] Total return percentage
  - [x] Basic equity curve chart

### API Integration
