## Core Simulation Engine (C++)

### Basic Engine Architecture

- [ ] Design core classes:

  - [ ] Position (individual stock holdings)
  - [ ] Order (buy/sell instructions)
  - [ ] Market (price data access interface)
- [ ] Implement time-stepping mechanism for simulation
- [ ] Create order execution logic (simple market orders first)

### Account Management

- [ ] Implement cash tracking and updates
- [ ] Create position tracking (shares owned, average price)
- [ ] Add basic transaction cost calculation (fixed commission)
- [ ] Implement simple portfolio value calculation

### Data Access Layer

- [ ] Create C++ PostgreSQL connection interface
- [ ] Build efficient price data retrieval methods
- [ ] Implement "current date" restriction (no future data access)
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data

## FastAPI Bridge Development 

### API Structure

- [x] Set up FastAPI project structure (main.py with database integration)
- [x] Create database connection layer (database.py with asyncpg)
- [x] Implement basic RESTful endpoints:
  - [x] GET /health - Database health check with stats
  - [x] GET /stocks - List available stock symbols
  - [x] GET /stocks/{symbol}/data - Historical data retrieval
  - [ ] POST /simulation/start
  - [ ] GET /simulation/{id}/status
  - [ ] GET /simulation/{id}/results
- [ ] Create C++ binding using pybind11 or ctypes

### Core Endpoints Implementation

- [x] Implement basic stock data endpoints
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and validation
- [x] Create API documentation with FastAPI's auto-docs (available at /docs)
- [x] Database connection pooling and health monitoring
- [ ] Implement simulation initialization endpoint
- [ ] Create simulation execution wrapper
- [ ] Build results retrieval endpoint

## Moving Average Crossover Algorithm

### Algorithm Implementation (C++)

- [ ] Create TradingStrategy base class/interface
- [ ] Implement Moving Average calculation functions
- [ ] Build MA Crossover strategy:
  - [ ] Configure short/long period parameters
  - [ ] Implement buy signal (short MA crosses above long MA)
  - [ ] Implement sell signal (short MA crosses below long MA)
  - [ ] Add position sizing logic (fixed percentage)

### Integration with Engine

- [ ] Connect strategy to simulation engine
- [ ] Implement strategy initialization
- [ ] Add daily strategy evaluation loop
- [ ] Create order generation from signals
- [ ] Test with sample data

## Basic React Frontend

### Project Setup

- [x] Configure React Router for navigation
- [x] Set up Axios for API communication
- [x] Install charting library (Chart.js or Recharts)
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up basic component structure

### Core Components

- [x] Create simulation setup form:
  - [x] Starting capital input
  - [x] Date range selector
  - [x] Stock selection (multi-select)
  - [x] Strategy parameters (MA periods)
- [x]Build simulation progress indicator
- [x] Implement results display page:
  - [x] Final portfolio value
  - [x] Total return percentage
  - [x] Basic equity curve chart

### API Integration

- [ ] Connect form submission to FastAPI
- [ ] Implement simulation status polling
- [ ] Handle and display API errors
- [ ] Create results fetching and parsing

## Integration & Testing

### End-to-End Testing

- [ ] Run complete simulation flow test
- [ ] Verify data accuracy at each step
- [ ] Test edge cases (market crashes, no trades)
- [ ] Performance test with larger datasets

### Bug Fixes & Refinements

- [ ] Fix identified issues from testing
- [ ] Optimize slow database queries
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add logging throughout system

### Documentation

- [ ] Write setup instructions
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create simple user guide
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic

## Deliverables Checklist

### Must Have for Phase 1 Completion

- [x] Working database with 10+ years of historical data for 25+ stocks
- [ ] C++ simulation engine executing basic trades
- [x] FastAPI successfully bridging frontend to backend (basic endpoints working)
- [ ] React UI allowing simulation setup and results viewing
- [ ] One working strategy (MA Crossover) with configurable parameters
- [ ] Basic performance metrics (total return, final value)

### Nice to Have (if time permits)

- [x] Docker compose for easy deployment
- [x] API documentation with FastAPI auto-docs
- [ ] Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks
- [ ] Simulation history/saved results
