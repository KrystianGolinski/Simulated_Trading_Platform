### Database Setup

- [x] Install PostgreSQL locally or set up cloud instance
- [x] Install TimescaleDB extension for time-series optimization
- [x] Create database schema for:
  - [ ] Stock metadata table (symbol, name, sector, exchange)
  - [x] Historical price data table (OHLCV with timestamps)
  - [ ] Trading sessions table
  - [ ] Trades log table
- [ ] Set up Redis for caching layer
- [ ] Create database connection utilities in Python

## Data Pipeline & Storage

### Data Source Integration

- [ ] Register for API access (Polygon.io/Alpaca/Yahoo Finance)
- [ ] Create Python scripts for data fetching
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to respect API constraints
- [ ] Build data validation functions (check for missing data, outliers)

### Historical Data Loading

- [x] Download sample dataset (start with 10-20 stocks, 5 years history)
- [ ] Implement data cleaning routines:
  - [ ] Handle stock splits and dividends
  - [ ] Adjust for missing trading days
  - [ ] Normalize price data
- [ ] Create batch import process to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Verify data integrity with test queries
- [ ] Set up automated daily data updates

## Core Simulation Engine (C++)

### Basic Engine Architecture

- [ ] Design core classes:
  - [ ] Portfolio (track positions and cash)
  - [ ] Position (individual stock holdings)
  - [ ] Order (buy/sell instructions)
  - [ ] Market (price data access interface)
- [ ] Implement time-stepping mechanism for simulation
- [ ] Create order execution logic (simple market orders first)

### Account Management

- [ ] Implement cash tracking and updates
- [ ] Create position tracking (shares owned, average price)
- [ ] Add basic transaction cost calculation (fixed commission)
- [ ] Implement simple portfolio value calculation

### Data Access Layer

- [ ] Create C++ PostgreSQL connection interface
- [ ] Build efficient price data retrieval methods
- [ ] Implement "current date" restriction (no future data access)
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data

## FastAPI Bridge Development

### API Structure

- [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Create C++ binding using pybind11 or ctypes
- [ ] Design RESTful endpoints:
  - [ ] POST /simulation/start
  - [ ] GET /simulation/{id}/status
  - [ ] GET /simulation/{id}/results
  - [ ] GET /stocks/available

### Core Endpoints Implementation

- [ ] Implement simulation initialization endpoint
- [ ] Create simulation execution wrapper
- [ ] Build results retrieval endpoint
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Create API documentation with FastAPI's auto-docs

## Moving Average Crossover Algorithm

### Algorithm Implementation (C++)

- [ ] Create TradingStrategy base class/interface
- [ ] Implement Moving Average calculation functions
- [ ] Build MA Crossover strategy:
  - [ ] Configure short/long period parameters
  - [ ] Implement buy signal (short MA crosses above long MA)
  - [ ] Implement sell signal (short MA crosses below long MA)
  - [ ] Add position sizing logic (fixed percentage)

### Integration with Engine

- [ ] Connect strategy to simulation engine
- [ ] Implement strategy initialization
- [ ] Add daily strategy evaluation loop
- [ ] Create order generation from signals
- [ ] Test with sample data

## Basic React Frontend

### Project Setup

- [ ] Configure React Router for navigation
- [ ] Set up Axios for API communication
- [ ] Install charting library (Chart.js or Recharts)
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up basic component structure

### Core Components

- [ ] Create simulation setup form:
  - [ ] Starting capital input
  - [ ] Date range selector
  - [ ] Stock selection (multi-select)
  - [ ] Strategy parameters (MA periods)
- [ ] Build simulation progress indicator
- [ ] Implement results display page:
  - [ ] Final portfolio value
  - [ ] Total return percentage
  - [ ] Basic equity curve chart

### API Integration

- [ ] Connect form submission to FastAPI
- [ ] Implement simulation status polling
- [ ] Handle and display API errors
- [ ] Create results fetching and parsing

## Integration & Testing

### End-to-End Testing

- [ ] Run complete simulation flow test
- [ ] Verify data accuracy at each step
- [ ] Test edge cases (market crashes, no trades)
- [ ] Performance test with larger datasets

### Bug Fixes & Refinements

- [ ] Fix identified issues from testing
- [ ] Optimize slow database queries
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add logging throughout system

### Documentation

- [ ] Write setup instructions
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create simple user guide
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic

## Deliverables Checklist

### Must Have for Phase 1 Completion

- [ ] Working database with 5+ years of historical data for 10+ stocks
- [ ] C++ simulation engine executing basic trades
- [ ] FastAPI successfully bridging frontend to backend
- [ ] React UI allowing simulation setup and results viewing
- [ ] One working strategy (MA Crossover) with configurable parameters
- [ ] Basic performance metrics (total return, final value)

### Nice to Have (if time permits)

- [ ] Docker compose for easy deployment
- [ ] Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation: API docs, architecture diagrams, user guides
- [ ] Simulation history/saved results
- [ ] Export results to CSV
- [ ] Loading states and progress bars

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can run a 1-year backtest on 5 stocks in under 10 seconds
- [ ] Results are reproducible (same inputs = same outputs)
- [ ] No crashes during normal operation
- [ ] UI is intuitive enough for basic use without documentation
