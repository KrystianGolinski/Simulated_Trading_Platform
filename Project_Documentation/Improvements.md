## API Layer Standardization

All API routers currently duplicate error response creation patterns and exception handling logic. This should be consolidated into a base router class or decorator that provides common error handling, logging, and response formatting functionality. The validation logic is also repeated across different endpoints and should be extracted into reusable validation mixins.

Database dependency injection patterns are identical across all routers and could benefit from a standardized approach. Creating helper functions or base classes for common database operations would reduce code duplication and make the API layer more consistent.

## Database and Caching Improvements

The current database queries load entire datasets into memory without pagination, which will become problematic as data volume grows. Implementing paginated queries with configurable page sizes would improve memory usage and response times. The caching system needs size limits and proper eviction policies to prevent memory leaks during long-running operations.

Connection pooling should be optimized with better configuration for concurrent access patterns. The current fixed pool sizes may not be sufficient for increased load, so implementing dynamic pool sizing with monitoring would help manage resources more effectively.

## Scalability Architecture Preparation

The current single-threaded simulation execution model needs to be enhanced to support concurrent simulations. Implementing an async simulation queue with worker processes would allow multiple simulations to run simultaneously without blocking each other. This would involve redesigning the simulation engine to be stateless and use external storage for simulation state.

The configuration processing system uses temporary files inefficiently and should be replaced with a more scalable approach. Creating a unified configuration processor that can handle different strategy types and parameter validation would prepare the system for more complex strategies and better resource management.

## Strategy Extension Framework

The current hardcoded strategy enumeration limits the system's ability to support new trading strategies. Implementing a plugin system with dynamic strategy loading would allow new strategies to be added without recompiling the entire engine. This would involve creating a strategy registry and standardized interfaces for strategy parameters and validation.

The strategy factory pattern should be enhanced to support runtime strategy discovery and validation. This would enable the system to automatically detect available strategies and their required parameters, making it easier to add new strategies and validate their configurations.

## Testing and Monitoring Infrastructure

The service layer testing could be more comprehensive with additional integration tests that verify the interaction between different services. This would help catch issues that unit tests might miss and ensure that service boundaries are properly maintained.

Adding performance monitoring and metrics collection would help identify bottlenecks as the system scales. Implementing structured logging with correlation IDs would make it easier to trace requests through the system and diagnose issues in production environments.
