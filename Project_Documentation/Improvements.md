## Architecture Improvements Implemented

- **Service-Based Architecture** (`trading_engine.cpp`, `database_service.cpp`, `execution_service.cpp`, `progress_service.cpp`)
  - Separated TradingEngine concerns into dedicated services following single responsibility principle
  - DatabaseService handles all data operations
  - ExecutionService manages signal execution logic
  - ProgressService handles progress reporting
  - Added dependency injection support for testability

## Future Enhancements

- **Interface Abstraction** - Create abstract base classes for services to enable better polymorphism and testing
- **Configuration Management** - Centralize service configuration through a dedicated config service
