Currently the project fulfills phase 1 of the implementation roadmap and goes quite past it but not at phase 2 yet. Heading into phase 2 now. Roadmap = 'Project_Documentation/Idea.md @ lines 115 onward'


**Trading Strategies**

Completed Strategies: MA_Crossover

Limitation: Only 1 stock can be used in simulations so far

**API**

The Python FastAPI is operational and tested

**Engine**

The engine succesfully runs 1 stock simulations and communicates via API with extensive testing architecture and optimisations

**Frontend**

The frontend is okay looking, takes in inputs and shows outputs via API so good enough

**Data**

Limited data (only like 10 years daily and like a week of intraday), sufficient for testing and short simulations

**Testing**

Sufficient testing throughout each part of the platform

**Docker**

Works on Linux, not sure about Windows at the minute
