# Simulated Trading Platform - Current Status Report

**Last Updated:** July 9, 2025  

## Version 1.3 

## Description:

A full-stack containerised platform consisting of an **API** (built using FastAPI), **C++ Backend Engine** and **Frontend** (React). Perform simulations on **44** stocks for date ranges of up to **10 Years** using strategies such as **MA_Crossover** or **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** with custom parameters per strategy. View performance metrics and simulation results with graphs on frontend. 

## Install/Setup

The platform is designed to handle any Linux system. Internet access is required. The script 'setup.sh' uses sudo which is powerful and should be noted that any user running a command through sudo should verify the integrity of the ran files. The script requires it to install system-wide dependencies such as Docker or C++ libraries. After successful installation the platform can be used through localhost:3000/ and running simulations via the frontend.

- 1: Clone repository
- 2: Change directory to root `(Simulated_Trading_Platform)`
- 3: Execute `sudo bash setup.sh` to run setup script
- 4: If ran **Not Successfully**:
  - 4.1: The script should inform you what went wrong.
- 5: Once ran **Successfully**:
  - 6: Change directory to Database `(Simulated_Trading_Platform/Database)`
  - 7: Execute `sudo bash DBsetup.sh` to populate platform database
  - 8: If ran **Not Successfully**:
    - 8.1: The script should inform you what went wrong
  - 9: If ran **Successfully**:
      - 10: Frontend will be available at localhost:3000/
      - 11: API will be available at localhost:8000/
- 12: To end docker services use `sudo docker compose -f Docker/docker-compose.dev.yml down`

If you encounter any issues, the platform uses the following pre-requisites:

- **General**: Docker, cmake, libpq-dev, python3.12-venv (The rest **should** and have been tested to self-install)
- **For Database**: yfinance, pandas, psycopg2

Installing/checking the presence of these libraries **could** solve the errors you may encounter.
